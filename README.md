# DEEPL-FaceTune
HSB DEEPL WS23/24 Project: Autoencoder based face manipulation


## Setup

Install the eel module:

    sudo apt install eel

## Start

To debug the application, start the main.py. VSCode projects will automatically recognize the included launch.json, which enables an F5-launch. The project is setup to not automatically open a browser window, as this wont work in WSL. Open it manually or wait for VSCode to ask for it.
